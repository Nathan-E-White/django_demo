# File: Requirements.txt

# Per the email from Feng:

1. it's a single page web app with Python (Flask or Django) as backend
2. the visualization should be able to show intraday data (1 hour or 1 minute data)
3. the visualization should automatically update as the backend sends the updated data
4. the backend should call an API or set up an real time stream to get the data (you can use any free APIs for financial or crypto timeseries data)
5. database is not required in this project
